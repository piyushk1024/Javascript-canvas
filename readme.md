*** jQuery and Javascript project ***

Main Aim:
To create a canvas on which when the user moves the mouse pointer, the subdivision of the
canvas is assigned a (random) color. The project is almost entirely Javascript/jQuery based with
HTML/CSS only providing skeletal code.

>The user can use the 'reset' button to clear the canvas and set the size/number of the canvas subdivision

>Each subsequent visit to a colored pixel darkens it by halving the RGB value, ultimately coloring it black

>Issues:
  Vertical Gap between consecutive pixels needs to addressed
  Optimisations required
